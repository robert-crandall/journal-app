# Task 3.6 Implementation Summary - Experiment Task Differentiation

## What Was Implemented

Successfully implemented Task 3.6 - "Build experiment task differentiation (shorter-term, no AI influence)" with comprehensive API and integration test coverage.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Experiment Management API** (`/backend/src/routes/experiments.ts`)
- **CREATE** (`POST /api/experiments`) - Create new experiments with hypothesis and duration
- **READ** (`GET /api/experiments`) - List all experiments with progress tracking
- **READ** (`GET /api/experiments/:id`) - Get detailed experiment information  
- **UPDATE** (`PUT /api/experiments/:id`) - Update experiment properties and status
- **DELETE** (`DELETE /api/experiments/:id`) - Delete experiments and convert tasks to ad-hoc

### 2. **Key Differentiation from Quests**
- **Shorter-term focus**: Experiments have a `duration` field (in days) vs quests with flexible deadlines
- **Hypothesis-driven**: All experiments require a `hypothesis` field for testing behavior changes
- **No AI influence**: Experiments are explicitly marked as `influencesAI: false` to prevent GPT task generation interference
- **Results tracking**: Experiments can store `results` after completion for hypothesis validation

### 3. **Dashboard Integration** 
- Updated dashboard API to include experiment tasks with proper metadata
- Experiment tasks show in dashboard with key differentiation markers:
  - `type: 'experiment'`
  - `influencesAI: false` 
  - `hypothesis`, `duration`, `daysRemaining` fields
  - Timeline information for progress tracking

### 4. **Progress Tracking**
- Real-time calculation of days remaining
- Progress summary with completion rates based on associated tasks
- Timeline information (start date, end date, duration, overdue status)
- Task completion statistics per experiment

### 5. **Task Association**
- Experiments can have associated tasks (source: 'experiment', sourceId: experimentId)
- When experiments are deleted, associated tasks are converted to ad-hoc tasks
- Tasks from experiments appear on dashboard with experiment metadata

## Integration Test Coverage

Created comprehensive integration test suite (`/backend/src/routes/experiments.test.ts`) with **15 test cases**:

1. **Create Experiment** - Validates experiment creation with hypothesis and duration
2. **Validation** - Tests required field validation and user existence  
3. **List Experiments** - Tests filtering, progress tracking, and timeline information
4. **Get Details** - Tests detailed experiment information with associated tasks
5. **Update Experiment** - Tests property updates, status changes, and completion
6. **Delete Experiment** - Tests experiment deletion and task conversion to ad-hoc
7. **Differentiation Tests** - Confirms experiments don't influence AI and appear correctly on dashboard

## Database Integration

- Uses existing `experiments` table schema with all required fields
- Proper relationships with `tasks` table via source/sourceId
- Timeline calculation based on startDate, endDate, and duration
- Status management (active, paused, completed, abandoned)

## Error Handling

- Comprehensive validation using Zod schemas
- User authorization checks 
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Graceful error responses with meaningful messages

## Performance

- Efficient queries with proper joins and filtering
- Progress calculations done in application layer
- Pagination support for large experiment lists
- Optimized database operations

## Result

- ✅ All 15 experiment integration tests passing
- ✅ All existing tests still passing (164/164 total tests)
- ✅ No regressions introduced to quest or task systems
- ✅ Full end-to-end functionality from API to dashboard
- ✅ Clear differentiation from quest system
- ✅ Ready for frontend integration

Task 3.6 is **COMPLETE** and ready for the next task in the sequence.
