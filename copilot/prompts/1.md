Can you start coding this app? The tech stack is Next.js (App Router), tRPC, Zod, Drizzle, and PostgreSQL (self-hosted). Use Tailwind CSS 4 for styling and layout. Assume I'm a solo developer and will use GPT to write most of the code, so consistency and type safety across the stack are critical.

See MATERIAL for UI instructions.

Please scaffold a new full-stack TypeScript project with the following features:

---

### ✅ Stack:
- Next.js with App Router (TypeScript)
- tRPC for backend API routes with type inference
- Zod for schema validation
- Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL (assume I’ve already set up the DB)
- Material UI (or Joy UI) with support for:
  - Dark mode
  - Light mode
  - System preference (`prefers-color-scheme`)
- Authentication using NextAuth (email/password is fine)

---

### ✅ Features:
1. **Authentication:**
   - Login and logout pages
   - Session-aware UI (show “Hello, [User]” when logged in)

3. **Dark/Light Mode:**
   - Add a toggle to switch between dark, light, and system modes
   - Save user preference in `localStorage`
   - Use DaisyUI's theme provider to handle themes globally
---

### ✅ Project Setup Notes:
- Organize code for mono-repo compatibility (e.g., separate `lib`, `trpc`, `db` folders if helpful)
- Use the new Next.js `app/` directory, not `pages/`
- Type safety should flow end-to-end (no `any` types)
- Use Drizzle with a PostgreSQL
- Include a `.env.example` with needed variables

---

### Output:
Start with the project scaffold and minimal implementations (not boilerplate comments). For now, aim to have the user register, login, and logout. Create an E2E test showing that works. Then I’ll ask you to implement or extend parts of it.
