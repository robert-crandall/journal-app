### 🏷️ Improve Content Tagging: Remove Static List & Add GPT Deduplication

**Summary:**
Content tags are currently only selected from a predefined list, which limits flexibility and causes poor tag alignment. This issue proposes removing the static list, allowing GPT to generate tags freely, and introducing a deduplication process to keep the tag database clean and manageable.

---

### ✅ Goals

- Let GPT generate new tags organically from journal or experiment content.
- Automatically deduplicate new tags against existing ones using GPT.
- Store new tags intelligently in the database with metadata.
- Keep the tag list from becoming bloated or redundant over time.

---

### 📦 Feature Breakdown

#### 1. **Remove Static Tag List from GPT Prompt**

- Eliminate the `"existingTags"` section that GPT sees.
- Update journal/experiment summary prompts to say:

  > “Suggest 3–6 content tags (topics, themes, or activities) that summarize the entry. Be concise and descriptive.”

---

#### 2. **Add GPT-Powered Tag Deduplication**

- After tags are generated by GPT, send both existing and new tags to GPT for deduplication.

##### Example Input:

```json
{
  "existingTags": ["family", "intimacy", "reflection"],
  "newTags": ["family time", "deep conversations", "introspection"]
}
```

##### GPT Prompt:

> You are helping to keep a tag list clean and readable. Given the existing tags and new suggestions, return a final list of new tags that do **not** duplicate or closely overlap the existing tags. Merge or simplify tags as needed.

##### Expected Output:

```json
["deep conversations", "introspection"]
```

---

#### 3. **Update Tag Table Schema**

Add the following fields:

- `name: string`
- `source: "user" | "discovered" | "system"`
- `timesUsed: number` (autoincremented when used)
- `status: "active" | "deprecated"` (optional, for hiding old tags)

---

#### 4. **Insert Cleaned Tags into DB**

- Final deduplicated tags should be inserted if they don't already exist.
- Tags should be lowercase, trimmed, and validated.

---

#### 5. **Future: Tag Curation Tools (Optional)**

Create a maintenance view where:

- Tags with `timesUsed <= 2` and `source = "discovered"` are reviewed.
- Tags can be manually merged or deprecated.

---

### 🧠 Nice to Have

- Include tags on experiment and journal detail pages as pills.
