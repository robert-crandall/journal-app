### ðŸ“Œ Feature Request: Add Manual Reflection Field to Weekly/Monthly Analysis

**Summary**
Add a new manual reflection field to Weekly and Monthly analysis entries. This allows the user to record subjective impressions of how well the week/month went, alongside the automatically generated analysis.

**Details**

- A new **`reflection`** field should be added to the Weekly/Monthly analysis model.
- This should be a **prominent text area** in the UI when creating or editing a Weekly/Monthly analysis.
- The comment should be **displayed on the list page** showing past analyses, making it easy to quickly scan historical reflections.
- This field is purely user-input, not generated by the system.
- Markdown support

**Acceptance Criteria**

- [x] Weekly analysis form includes a prominent "Reflection" text field.
- [x] Monthly analysis form includes a prominent "Reflection" text field.
- [x] The entered reflection is saved to the database.
- [x] Reflection is displayed on the list/index page of analyses.
- [x] Reflections are visible when viewing an individual analysis entry.

**Backend Implementation Status**

- [x] Database migration completed (added reflection column)
- [x] Backend API updated to handle reflection field
- [x] Types and validation updated
- [x] All backend tests passing (588/588)

**Frontend Implementation Status**

- [x] Added reflection display and editing to weekly analysis detail page
- [x] Added reflection indicators to weekly analysis list page
- [x] Reflection field prioritized in preview text over AI-generated content
- [x] Frontend compiles successfully with no TypeScript errors

**Why**
Objective data and AI-generated analysis are useful, but users also need space for **subjective reflections** about how their week/month felt. This balances data with self-assessment and makes reviewing history more meaningful.
