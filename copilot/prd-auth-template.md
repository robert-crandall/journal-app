# Product Requirements Document: Authentication Template

## Introduction/Overview

This document outlines the requirements for a streamlined authentication system that will serve as a foundation for future applications. The primary purpose of this template is to demonstrate a complete end-to-end testing implementation following the project's testing guidelines, while providing essential user registration and login functionality. This template will enable developers to quickly bootstrap new applications with a robust, well-tested authentication system.

## Goals

1. Create a minimal but complete authentication system with registration and login capabilities
2. Implement comprehensive end-to-end testing covering both backend and frontend
3. Establish a reusable template that can serve as a foundation for future applications
4. Demonstrate best practices for integration between Hono backend and SvelteKit frontend
5. Provide a secure authentication implementation using JWT

## User Stories

1. **Registration:** As a new user, I want to register for an account when registration is enabled, so that I can access the application.
2. **Login:** As a registered user, I want to log in to the application, so that I can access my account.
3. **Remembered Login:** As a returning user, I want the option to stay logged in, so that I don't have to re-enter my credentials every time I visit the site.
4. **Registration Restriction:** As a system administrator, I want to control when user registration is available, so that I can manage access to the application.

## Functional Requirements

### User Registration

1. The system must provide a registration form with fields for name, email, and password.
2. The system must validate all form fields on the client side:
   - Name: Required, maximum 100 characters
   - Email: Required, valid email format
   - Password: Required, minimum 6 characters. This is a simple field, all lowercase is fine.
3. The system must perform server-side validation of all fields with the same requirements.
4. The system must check for existing users with the same email and reject registrations with duplicate emails.
5. The system must securely hash passwords before storing them in the database.
6. The system must only allow registration when the environment variable `ALLOW_REGISTRATION` is set to "true".
7. The system must return appropriate error messages for validation failures.
8. The system must create a new user record in the database upon successful registration.
9. The system must issue a JWT token upon successful registration and log the user in automatically.
10. JWT tokens are valid for 30 days.

### User Login

10. The system must provide a login form with fields for email and password.
11. The system must validate form fields on the client side:
    - Email: Required, valid email format
    - Password: Required
12. The system must verify the user's credentials against the database.
13. The system must provide clear error messages for invalid login attempts.
14. The system must issue a JWT token upon successful login.
15. The system must provide a "Remember me" option that extends the JWT token expiration time when selected.
16. The system must allow manual password reset for users with database access (no email-based reset flow required).

### General Authentication

17. The system must protect routes that require authentication.
18. The system must verify JWT tokens for validity and expiration on protected routes.
19. The system must handle token expiration gracefully, redirecting to the login page when needed.
20. The system must allow users to log out, which invalidates their current token.

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. Multi-factor authentication
2. Social login options (Google, GitHub, etc.)
3. Password reset via email
4. User profile management
5. Multiple user roles/permissions
6. Account deletion functionality
7. Session management across multiple devices
8. Brute force protection/login throttling

## Design Considerations

1. Follow mobile-first design approach as specified in the coding instructions.
2. Use daisyUI for component styling.
3. Implement a clean, minimalist interface focusing on usability.
4. Provide clear visual feedback for form validation errors.
5. Ensure all UI elements meet minimum touch target size requirements (44px) for mobile devices.
6. Follow existing color palette and design system as specified in robert-crandall.instructions.md.

## Technical Considerations

1. **Backend:**
   - Use Hono as the backend framework with first-party middleware
   - Implement JWT authentication using hono/jwt
   - Use PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for database operations
   - Implement proper validation using Hono's built-in validators

2. **Frontend:**
   - Use SvelteKit configured for SPA deployment
   - Configure for iOS Safari compatibility (iOS 16+)
   - Implement client-side form validation
   - Store JWT token securely (localStorage for "remember me", otherwise sessionStorage)

3. **Testing:**
   - Implement complete end-to-end testing as specified in hono.test.instructions.md and sveltekit.test.instructions.md
   - Test all user flows using real HTTP requests and browser interactions
   - Include both happy path and error case testing
   - Test both backend API endpoints and frontend interactions

4. **Environment Configuration:**
   - Implement `ALLOW_REGISTRATION` environment variable to control registration availability
   - Store JWT secret in environment variables
