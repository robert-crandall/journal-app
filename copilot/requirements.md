# 🛠 Life Quest — Requirements Document

## 🎯 Purpose

Create an app that helps me live a life aligned with my values by deeply understanding who I am and guiding me through daily actions that reinforce the person I want to become.

This app is a cross between:

* A **journal** that helps me reflect and learn
* A **task system** that nudges me into aligned action
* An **RPG-style life dashboard** with stats, XP, and character growth

---

## 🧱 Core Concepts

### 1. Character

* Every user has a "character" with:

  * A **class** (e.g. Ranger) and a **backstory**
  * A list of **stats** (e.g. Strength, Wisdom, Fatherhood)

    * Each stat has:

      * A description
      * Sample activities that generate XP
      * A current XP total and level (leveling is manual)
      * Humorous level names (generated by GPT)
* Stats gain XP from:

  * Completing tasks
  * Tagged journal entries

---

### 2. Journal

* A conversational, GPT-assisted journal
* The user can write freely or respond to prompts
* After entry, GPT will extract:

  * A **summary** (stitched version of the conversation)
  * A **synopsis** (1–2 sentence recap)
  * A **title** (6–10 words)
  * **Tags**:

    * Topics (e.g. “relationship”, “nature”)
    * Moods (from a fixed set, e.g. “calm”, “overwhelmed”)
    * Stats (from user's existing list — grants XP)
* Entries can be linked to active **Tracks**

---

### 3. Tasks

* Unified task system with a `source_type`:

  * `track_task`: Recurring or one-off tasks from Tracks (quests, experiments, goals)
  * `initiative_task`: Manual subtasks from Projects or Adventures
  * `manual`: Ad-hoc XP-earning tasks (e.g. "Workout")
  * `todo`: Simple one-off reminders (e.g. "Pick up groceries")
* Tasks can optionally:

  * Link to a stat (for XP)
  * Link to a family member
  * Recur daily (for habits)

---

### 4. Tracks

Tracks represent intentional life directions. Types include:

* `quest`: Long-term personal commitment
* `experiment`: Time-boxed behavioral trial
* `goal`: An aspiration or vision

Each Track includes:

* Title, description, start/end date
* Optional daily task config (e.g. “Take a walk”)
* Auto-associates journal entries written during the track
* A dashboard showing:

  * Completion rate
  * Stats improved
  * Related journal entries
  * Mood and tag breakdowns

---

### 5. Initiatives

Used to manage multi-step efforts. Includes:

* `project`: Practical/maintenance ("Clean garage")
* `adventure`: Fun/exploratory ("Backpack Mt. Hood")

Initiatives have:

* Title, description
* List of subtasks
* Referenceable by GPT for task suggestions

---

### 6. Family

* Add family members with name, description, likes/dislikes
* Log past activities with each person
* GPT uses this to suggest connection-oriented tasks (e.g. “Play a game with your youngest son”)

---

### 7. GPT Integration

GPT acts as a **Life Dungeon Master (DM)**:

* Uses context from:

  * Character
  * Active tracks and initiatives
  * Family
  * Weather (optional)
  * Recent tasks and journal entries
* Generates:

  * Daily task suggestions (one for self, one for connection)
  * Journal follow-up questions
  * Journal analysis and tagging
  * Humorous level titles

---

## 🖥 Dashboard

The homepage shows:

* **Daily tasks**
* **Mark as complete** with XP feedback
* **Quick journal entry** button
* XP stats and progress
* Motivational quote or character banner

---

## ⚙️ Technical Notes

* Built for **INTJ + ADHD users**: clean UI, low friction, structured reflection
* All major data types support **CRUD**
* Database: **PostgreSQL**
* ORM: **Drizzle**
* Optionally: full-stack SvelteKit or Next.js — consistent code path for GPT integration
