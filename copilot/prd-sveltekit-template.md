# PRD: SvelteKit Full-Stack Template Application

## Introduction/Overview

This project creates a comprehensive, production-ready SvelteKit 2 template application that serves as a foundation for future projects. The template demonstrates modern full-stack development patterns with authentication, database integration, responsive design, and theme management. It solves the problem of repeatedly setting up the same foundational features across multiple projects by providing a battle-tested starting point.

The primary goal is to create a reusable template that showcases best practices for SvelteKit development while providing essential features that most applications need.

## Goals

1. Create a production-ready SvelteKit 2 template with modern tooling
2. Implement secure user authentication with email/password registration and login
3. Demonstrate server-side data handling with protected routes
4. Provide responsive Material Design 3 UI using TailwindCSS 4 and DaisyUI 5
5. Include comprehensive theme management (light/dark/auto modes)
6. Establish testing infrastructure for both unit and end-to-end testing
7. Configure development tools for code quality and consistency
8. Showcase DaisyUI component library with practical examples

## User Stories

### Authentication

- As a new user, I want to register with my email, password, and display name so that I can access the application
- As a returning user, I want to log in with my credentials so that I can access my account
- As a logged-in user, I want to log out securely so that my session is properly terminated
- As a user, I want my login session to persist across browser sessions so that I don't have to log in repeatedly

### Content Management

- As a logged-in user, I want to create markdown content through a form so that I can store my thoughts/notes
- As a logged-in user, I want to view my previously submitted content so that I can review what I've created
- As a logged-in user, I want to see my content rendered from markdown so that it displays with proper formatting

### Theme & UI

- As a user, I want the application to automatically detect my system theme preference so that it matches my device settings
- As a user, I want to manually override the theme selection so that I can choose my preferred appearance
- As a user, I want the interface to be responsive so that it works well on both desktop and mobile devices
- As a developer, I want to see examples of DaisyUI components so that I understand how to use them in future projects

15. The system must render markdown content to HTML for display
16. The system must show a list/view of the user's previously submitted content
17. The system must demonstrate server-side data loading for protected pages
18. The system must validate and sanitize user input before storage

### UI/UX Requirements

19. The system must implement Material Design 3 principles using DaisyUI components
20. The system must be mobile-first responsive across all screen sizes
21. The system must provide theme selection with light, dark, and auto options
22. The system must persist user theme preferences
23. The system must automatically detect and apply system theme preferences when set to auto
24. The system must include a navigation system accessible on both desktop and mobile
25. The system must showcase various DaisyUI components in practical contexts
26. The system must use Lucide icons consistently throughout the interface
27. The system must avoid emojis in production UI elements

### Developer Experience

28. The system must include comprehensive testing setup (unit tests with Vitest, E2E tests with Playwright)
29. The system must include ESLint and Prettier configuration for code quality
30. The system must include Docker setup for easy deployment
31. The system must follow TypeScript best practices with proper type safety
32. The system must include clear documentation for setup and usage
33. The system must demonstrate proper error handling patterns
34. The system must include development scripts for common tasks

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- **Advanced Authentication**: Social login, 2FA, password reset (basic template only)
- **Advanced Content Features**: Rich text editor, file uploads, content editing/deletion
- **User Management**: Admin interfaces, user roles, profile management beyond display name
- **Performance Optimization**: Advanced caching, CDN integration, image optimization
- **Deployment Configuration**: Specific hosting platform setup (Docker only)
- **Internationalization**: Multi-language support
- **Advanced Testing**: Performance testing, load testing, security testing
- **Real-time Features**: WebSocket connections, live updates, notifications
- **Advanced UI**: Custom animations, complex layouts, advanced interactions
- **Third-party Integrations**: External APIs, payment processing, analytics

## Design Considerations

### Material Design 3 Implementation

- Follow Material Design 3 principles with clean, efficient interfaces optimized for INTJ users
- Use DaisyUI for color and theme management with semantic color names (primary, secondary, etc.)
- Implement desktop-first design patterns with full-width layouts rather than centered narrow forms
- Use contextual sidebars for tips and live previews where appropriate
- Avoid redundant labels when title and helper text provide sufficient context

### Component Library Showcase

- Create example pages demonstrating various DaisyUI components (cards, forms, buttons, navigation, etc.)
- Show practical usage patterns rather than isolated component demos
- Include both simple and complex component combinations
- Demonstrate responsive behavior across different screen sizes

### Navigation & Layout

- Implement responsive navigation that works well on both desktop and mobile
- Use hamburger menu pattern for mobile devices
- Create clear hierarchy and navigation flow
- Ensure accessibility standards are met

## Technical Considerations

### Stack Requirements

- **Frontend**: SvelteKit 2 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS 4 + DaisyUI 5
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Testing**: Vitest (unit) + Playwright (E2E)
- **Code Quality**: ESLint + Prettier
- **Icons**: Lucide icons exclusively
- **Deployment**: Docker containerization

### Security Considerations

- Implement proper password hashing (bcrypt or similar)
- Use secure session management
- Implement CSRF protection
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information

### Database Schema

- Users table: id, email, password_hash, name, created_at, updated_at
- Content table: id, user_id, title, content (markdown), created_at, updated_at
- Sessions table for secure session management

### Development Workflow

- Follow the feature development cycle outlined in copilot instructions
- Implement database schema and migrations first
- Build server-side functionality with proper type exports
- Create comprehensive server integration tests
- Implement client-side components importing server types
- Add end-to-end tests for complete user workflows

## Open Questions

1. **Content Organization**: Should the content be organized in any specific way (categories, tags, folders) or just a simple chronological list?
2. **Theme Persistence**: Should theme preferences be stored per-user in the database or just in local storage?
3. **Content Limits**: Should there be any limits on content length or number of entries per user?
4. **Example Content**: Should the template include some sample content to demonstrate the markdown rendering?
5. **Error Pages**: Should custom error pages (404, 500, etc.) be included in the template?
6. **PWA Features**: Should Progressive Web App features (service worker, offline capabilities) be included?
7. **Development Data**: Should the template include database seeding for development/testing purposes?
