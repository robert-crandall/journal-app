# Product Requirements Document: D&D Life Gamification App Frontend

## Introduction/Overview

Create a modern, responsive frontend for the D&D Life Gamification App using SvelteKit in SPA mode. The frontend will provide an intuitive interface for users to interact with their gamified personal development system, featuring character progression, task management, and reflective journaling.

**Problem Statement**: The existing backend system needs a user-friendly frontend that makes the gamification system accessible and engaging across devices, particularly optimized for mobile iOS Safari.

**Solution**: A SvelteKit SPA with dark/light mode support, Hono stack integration for type-safe API communication, and a design system that encourages daily engagement with personal development activities.

## Goals

1. **Seamless User Experience**: Create an intuitive interface that reduces friction in daily task completion and journal entry
2. **Mobile-First Excellence**: Optimize for iOS Safari with PWA capabilities while maintaining desktop functionality
3. **Type Safety**: Implement end-to-end type safety using Hono stacks between frontend and backend
4. **Theme Support**: Provide comprehensive dark/light mode support with potential for additional themes
5. **Performance**: Fast loading, responsive interactions, and smooth animations on mobile devices
6. **Accessibility**: Meet WCAG standards for inclusive design

## User Stories

**As a mobile user**, I want a responsive interface that works perfectly on my iPhone so that I can easily complete tasks and journal entries throughout the day.

**As a visual learner**, I want clear progress bars and level displays so that I can see my character growth at a glance.

**As someone who uses my phone in different lighting**, I want dark and light mode options so that the app is comfortable to use in any environment.

**As a daily app user**, I want fast load times and smooth animations so that checking my dashboard doesn't feel sluggish.

**As a user with accessibility needs**, I want proper keyboard navigation and screen reader support so that I can use all app features.

**As a developer**, I want type-safe API calls so that frontend-backend integration is reliable and maintainable.

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Offline functionality or data caching (except authentication)
- Real-time collaboration features
- Advanced animations or game-like graphics
- Third-party integrations (fitness trackers, calendar apps)
- Complex data visualization beyond progress bars and level displays
- Custom theme creation beyond dark/light mode
- Advanced accessibility features beyond WCAG AA compliance
- Native mobile app (PWA only)
- Desktop-specific features that don't work on mobile

## Design Considerations

- **Reference Design**: Follow the layout and styling patterns from https://journal.crandalls.cloud
- **Component Library**: Use DaisyUI for rapid development with theme support, supplement with Shadcn components as needed
- **Color System**: Implement semantic color tokens (primary, secondary, accent) that work across light/dark themes
- **Typography**: Use responsive typography scale that works well on mobile and desktop
- **Spacing**: Consistent spacing system using Tailwind's spacing scale
- **Interactive Elements**: Provide clear hover/focus states for desktop, appropriate touch feedback for mobile
- **Loading States**: Use skeleton loaders and progress indicators for better perceived performance
- **Error States**: Clear error messages with actionable next steps

## Technical Considerations

- **SvelteKit Configuration**: Use `@sveltejs/adapter-static` with SPA mode (`fallback: 'index.html'`)
- **Type Safety**: Import all types from `backend/src/db/schema.ts` and route files
- **API Client**: Create centralized API client using `hc` from `@hono/client`
- **State Management**: Use Svelte stores for global state (auth, theme preferences)
- **Routing**: Leverage SvelteKit's file-based routing for logical page organization
- **Build Optimization**: Implement code splitting and lazy loading for optimal bundle size
- **Environment Variables**: Use Vite environment variables for API endpoints
- **Testing**: Include component tests using Vitest and browser testing utilities
- **Deployment**: Configure for static hosting with proper routing fallbacks
