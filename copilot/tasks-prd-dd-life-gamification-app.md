### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing
- Use `bun test` to run all tests or `bun test [path]` for specific test files
- Integration tests will make real API calls to test end-to-end functionality
- Backend uses Hono with PostgreSQL and Drizzle ORM
- Frontend uses SvelteKit 5 with type-safe API integration via Hono client
