You are a senior product strategist and full-stack engineer.

I will give you a long-form requirements document describing a complex application. Your job is to break this into a clear development roadmap designed for a solo developer.

Your roadmap should include:

1. A list of **high-level features or modules** (e.g., journal system, task engine, GPT orchestration). 
   - Each feature should have a **brief description** (1â€“2 sentences max).
   - If a feature **depends on another**, mention that clearly.

2. Group these features into **logical development phases**, considering:
   - Feature dependencies
   - Whatâ€™s required for a minimum viable product (MVP)
   - ADHD-friendly development flow (build useful features early, layer in complexity)
   - Solo development constraints (avoid building too many systems at once)

Output format:

- [ ] **Feature Name**
  - Description:
  - Depends on:

Then, at the end:

### ðŸ§© Suggested Build Phases
_Phase 1: ..._  
_Phase 2: ..._
