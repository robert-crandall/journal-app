Here is what you need to know about Tailwind CSS v4 (May 2025)

### I. Core Architecture & Performance

1.  **New Engine - Performance First:**
    - V4 ships with a completely rewritten engine. Expect drastically reduced build times – typically sub-10ms for most projects, even large ones often under 100ms. This is achieved by more efficiently parsing sources and generating CSS on-demand.
2.  **CSS-First Configuration via `@theme`:**
    - The primary configuration mechanism shifts from `tailwind.config.js` (for theme values) to your main CSS file using the `@theme` directive.

      ```css
      /* app.css */
      @import 'tailwindcss';

      @theme {
        --font-sans: 'Inter', system-ui, sans-serif;
        --color-brand-500: oklch(0.637 0.237 25.331); /* Journal OKLCH color */
        --breakpoint-lg: 64rem;
        --spacing: 0.25rem; /* Base for numeric spacing utilities */
      }
      ```

    - Theme values are defined as CSS custom properties (variables). Tailwind uses these to generate corresponding utility classes (e.g., `font-sans`, `bg-brand-500`, `lg:p-(--spacing-4)`) and also makes these variables globally available for use in custom CSS or arbitrary values (e.g., `var(--color-brand-500)`).
    - The default theme is still provided but can be extended, overridden, or entirely replaced using this CSS-native approach. For instance, `--color-*: initial;` within `@theme` will remove all default color utilities, allowing a fully custom palette.

3.  **Modern CSS Baseline:**
    - Targets **Safari 16.4+, Chrome 111+, Firefox 128+**. This is non-negotiable as v4 relies on features like `@property`, `color-mix()`, and modern cascade layers. Older browser support requires sticking to v3.4.
    - The default color palette leverages OKLCH for more vibrant, perceptually uniform colors out-of-the-box.

### II. Build & Integration

1.  **Simplified Imports:**
    - The `@tailwind base; @tailwind components; @tailwind utilities;` directives are deprecated. A single `@import "tailwindcss";` now handles the injection of base styles (Preflight), theme variables, and utilities into their respective cascade layers.
2.  **Modular Tooling Packages:**
    - **CLI:** `npx @tailwindcss/cli ...` (package: `@tailwindcss/cli`)
    - **PostCSS Plugin:** `@tailwindcss/postcss` (package: `@tailwindcss/postcss`)
    - **Vite Plugin:** `@tailwindcss/vite` (package: `@tailwindcss/vite`) - Recommended for Vite projects due to optimized performance and DX.
3.  **Internalized Processing:**
    - `postcss-import` and `autoprefixer` are generally no longer required as separate dependencies. Tailwind v4 handles CSS bundling and vendor prefixing (via Lightning CSS) internally.

### III. Key Migration Considerations & API Changes (v3 -> v4)

1.  **Configuration File Shift:**
    - While `tailwind.config.js` can still be used for plugin definitions or complex setups (loaded via `@config "path/to/config.js";`), theme customization (colors, spacing, fonts, breakpoints) should primarily occur in CSS via `@theme`.
    - The `content` array for source file scanning is still primarily configured via JS config if used, or Tailwind attempts automatic detection. Use `@source` in CSS for explicit path additions/exclusions.
2.  **Utility Deprecations & Renames:**
    - The `npx @tailwindcss/upgrade` tool is highly recommended and automates most of this.
    - Opacity syntax is now consistently `bg-black/50` (no more `bg-opacity-50`).
    - Scales for `shadow`, `rounded`, and `blur` have been normalized (e.g., `shadow` -> `shadow-sm`, `shadow-sm` -> `shadow-xs`).
    - `ring` default width is now `1px` (was `3px`); use `ring-3` for the old default.
3.  **Default Value Adjustments:**
    - Default border color is now `currentColor`. Explicitly add color classes like `border-gray-200` if you relied on the v3 default gray.
    - Default ring color is `currentColor` (was `blue-500`).
4.  **Selector Modifications:**
    - `space-x-*`/`space-y-*` utilities now use `margin-bottom`/`margin-right` on `:not(:last-child)` for performance. This might affect inline elements or layouts with existing tweaked margins. Flex/grid `gap` is often a better alternative.
    - Variant stacking order is now left-to-right (e.g., `dark:md:hover:bg-red-500`) for CSS-like consistency.
5.  **Custom Utility Definition:**
    - `@utility` directive replaces `@layer components` or `@layer utilities` for defining custom, variant-aware utility classes. This ensures proper integration with Tailwind's engine and cascade layers.
      ```css
      @utility btn-primary {
        background-color: var(--color-brand-500);
        /* ... */
      }
      ```
    - Functional utilities (e.g., `tab-*` matching `tab-2`, `tab-github`) are defined using `@utility` with a `--value()` function to parse arguments and match theme keys or arbitrary values.
6.  **`@apply` in Scoped Styles (Vue SFCs, Svelte, CSS Modules):**
    - Due to isolated processing of these style blocks by build tools, theme variables, custom utilities, and variants defined in global CSS are not automatically available.
    - Use `@reference "../path/to/your/main.css";` _inside_ the scoped style block to make these available without duplicating CSS output.
    - Alternatively, directly use CSS variables (`var(--color-brand-500)`) instead of `@apply` for better performance and simpler processing.
7.  **Prefix Syntax:**
    - Utility prefixes are now variant-like: `tw:bg-red-500`. Theme variables in `@theme` remain unprefixed, but generated CSS variables _will_ be prefixed (e.g., `--tw-color-red-500`).
8.  **Arbitrary Value Syntax for CSS Variables:**
    - Using CSS variables in arbitrary values now uses parentheses: `bg-(--my-brand-color)` instead of `bg-[--my-brand-color]`. This resolves ambiguity with other arbitrary value types.

### IV. Advanced Capabilities & Modern CSS Integration

1.  **Enhanced Variant System:**
    - Comprehensive support for ARIA attributes (`aria-checked:`, `aria-disabled:`). Custom `aria-*` variants can be defined.
    - Data attribute variants (`data-[size=large]:`, `data-active:`).
    - `:has()` pseudo-class support via `has-*` variants (e.g., `has-[:focus]:`).
    - Child (`*`) and descendant (`**`) combinator variants (e.g., `*:p-2`, `**:data-avatar:rounded-full`).
    - `group-*` and `peer-*` variants can now be named for more complex nesting/sibling scenarios (e.g., `group/item`, `peer-checked/opt1:`).
2.  **Container Queries:**
    - Enabled via `@container` class on the parent.
    - Size-based variants (`@sm:`, `@lg:`, or arbitrary `@min-[475px]:`) style children based on the container's width.
    - Named containers (`@container/sidebar`, `@lg/sidebar:`) allow targeting specific ancestor containers.
    - Container query length units (`cqw`, `cqi`) can be used in arbitrary values (e.g., `w-[50cqw]`).
3.  **Native CSS Features:**
    - Tailwind v4 is built upon and encourages the use of native CSS variables, nesting (processed by Lightning CSS), `color-mix()`, `calc()`, etc.

### V. Workflow Adjustments & Deprecations

1.  **Preprocessors (Sass/Less/Stylus):**
    - Not designed for use with Tailwind v4. Tailwind itself, with its CSS-native features and internal processing via Lightning CSS, fulfills most preprocessor roles.
2.  **`theme()` Function in CSS:**
    - Deprecated. Use `var(--css-variable-name)` instead. For media queries where `var()` isn't supported, `theme(--breakpoint-xl)` (using the CSS variable name) can be used.
3.  **`corePlugins` in JS Config:**
    - Disabling core plugins via JS config is no longer supported. Manage utility generation by not using unwanted classes or explicitly excluding them if necessary via `@source not inline(...)`.

Tailwind CSS v4 represents a leaner, faster, and more CSS-idiomatic approach. The upgrade tool (`npx @tailwindcss/upgrade`) is crucial for v3 projects. For new projects, understanding the CSS-first configuration and modern CSS dependencies is key.
